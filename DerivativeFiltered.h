//The Transfer Function of a plain derivative is s
//The TF of a single pole filter with cutoff angular velocity N rad/s is N / (s + N)
//A filter with a derivative in cascade give a TF of sN / (s + N)
//The same can be obtained by using a negative feedback loop with a single gain N on the direct path, and a simple integrator on the feedback path
//See video https://www.mathworks.com/videos/understanding-pid-control-part-2-expanding-beyond-a-simple-integral-1528310418260.html
//Also, since the derivative is going to be multiplied by the gain Kp, we are embedding it into two coefs, so that we save operations
//Important Note!: The cotoff  frequency N should be chosen less than the sampling frequency 1/dt. Or else oscillations will appear
